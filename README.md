# Library App
As instructed by The Odin Project, this library app will utilise the intermediate object and object constructor skills I've learned.

## Skills 
**HTML and CSS**
- Creating and styling a form 
- Creating and styling a dialog - for elements that make others inactive!
- Combining grid and flexbox
- Using various selectors 

**JavaScript**
- Using id's to find certain items in an array (rather than using index)
- Linking prototypes to localise functions
