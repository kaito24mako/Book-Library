# Book Library
As instructed by The Odin Project, this library app will utilise the intermediate object and object constructor skills I've learned.

## Skills 
**HTML and CSS**
- Creating and styling form 
- Creating and styling dialog - for elements that make others inactive!
- Combining grid and flexbox
- Using various selectors 

**JavaScript**
- Creating objects and object constructors 
- Looping over objects 
- Linking prototypes to localise functions 
- Using id's to find certain items in an array (rather than using index)
- Opening, closing, and resetting dialog
